# Merge-Sort-Algorithm

1. Recall the “Building Block” strategy discussed in previous classes. Using this strategy:
- Implement “merge” algorithm as a building block (as a function).
- Implement “mergeSort” algorithm using recursion. Use “merge” as the building block in the implementation of mergeSort.
- Test your program on a randomly generated list of 100 integers and display the output.
